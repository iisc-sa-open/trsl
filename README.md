# Tree based statistical language model

This work is based on the paper:
> A Tree-Based Statistical Language Model for Natural Language Speech Recognition (1989)
> by L R Bahl, P F Brown, P V de Souza, R L Mercer 

Python is the primary language to be used in this implementation. The idea is to see if the finished work can reside in the [NLTK](https://github.com/nltk)
